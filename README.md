## ✨ About the Project  
The RAG QA Chatbot is a robust solution for answering queries on insurance documents. Understanding and interpreting large, complex insurance policies can be challenging. This chatbot simplifies the process by combining document retrieval techniques with advanced generative AI models, delivering accurate answers in real-time.  

---  

## 🔍 Key Features  
- 🌟 **Accurate Responses**: Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to ensure precise answers.  
- ⚡ **Efficient Embedding Storage**: Leverages **ChromaDB** for fast, scalable embedding storage and retrieval.  
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Generation**: Combines OpenAI embeddings with Gemini Flash Model for high-quality answer generation.  
- 🛠️ **Caching Mechanisms**: Implements cache layers for:  
  - Embedding storage to avoid reprocessing identical documents.  
  - Query responses to skip re-evaluating repeated questions.  
- 📄 **Page-Level Chunking**: Splits documents into manageable sections for optimal retrieval performance.  
- 🤖 **Real-Time Interaction**: Instantly retrieves and processes relevant document sections for user queries.
